Yubico-bitcoin-java
-------------------

Java client library for communicating with the ykneo-bitcoin applet
for the YubiKey NEO.

This library exposes the Bitcoin BIP32 functionality that
ykneo-bitcoin provides. It can be used to implement YubiKey NEO
support for bitcoin wallets.

This project consists of the following modules:

 * yubico-bitcoin-java-core:
    This is the main API and common utility classes.
 * yubico-bitcoin-java-pcsc:
    A smartcard implementation of YkneoBitcoin, communicating with the YubiKey 
    NEO over USB using PC/SC.
 * yubico-bitcoin-java-android:
    An Android implementation of YkneoBitcoin, communicating with the YubiKey
    NEO over NFC.
 * yubico-bitcoin-java-soft:
    A software implementation of YkneoBitcoin for testing purposes, that 
    doesn't use a YubiKey NEO at all.
 * yubico-bitcoin-java-examples:
    Sample code for working with YkneoBitcoin.
