    NEO over USB using PC/SC.
 * yubico-bitcoin-java-android:
    An Android implementation of YkneoBitcoin, communicating with the YubiKey
    NEO over NFC.
 * yubico-bitcoin-java-soft:
    A software implementation of YkneoBitcoin for testing purposes, that 
    doesn't use a YubiKey NEO at all.
 * yubico-bitcoin-java-examples:
    Sample code for working with YkneoBitcoin.
